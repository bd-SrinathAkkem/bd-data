**Subject:** Follow-Up on Application ‚Äì Software Engineer II (ID: 2025-24494)

Dear Vidya,

I am writing to follow up on my application for the **Software Engineer II** role at Blackhawk Network. Please find my resume attached again for your reference.

I bring **hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, AWS, and MySQL**. At **Black Duck Software**, I built a bulk onboarding platform ([https://integrations.blackduck.com/onboard/](https://integrations.blackduck.com/onboard/)), developed scalable Java microservices on AWS, and optimized SQL queries for performance. Previously at **TCS**, I contributed to backend development for DaVita‚Äôs patient management system, designing and testing 25+ REST APIs that boosted performance by 30%.
